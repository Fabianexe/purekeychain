A pure Go implementation for accessing the macOS Keychain without CGO dependencies. 
This library provides a simple API to interact with the macOS Keychain Services, 
allowing secure credential management while maintaining Go's cross-compilation benefits.

## Features

- ‚ú® Pure Go implementation (no CGO required)
- üîê Secure access to macOS Keychain
- üõ† Cross-compilation friendly

## Why purekeychain?

Most macOS Keychain libraries in Go rely on CGO, which can complicate cross-compilation and increase build complexity.
This library uses `purego` to provide direct access to the macOS Keychain APIs without CGO,
making it easier to maintain and integrate into your projects.

## Installation
```bash
go get github.com/Fabianexe/purekeychain
```

## Requirements
- macOS 10.13 or later
- Go 1.24 or later

## Usage
The purekeychain library provides a simple interface to interact with the macOS Keychain. The library uses a service-based approach where each service can store credentials like username/password pairs.
### Creating a Service
First, create a Service object that will interact with the keychain:
```go
import "github.com/Fabianexe/purekeychain"

// Create a new service with a name
service := purekeychain.New("MyAppService")
```
### Saving Credentials
Save username/password credentials to the keychain:
```go
// Save login credentials
err := service.Save("username", "password123")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to save to keychain: %v", err)
}
```
### Retrieving Credentials
Retrieve the credentials for a service:
```go
// Retrieve credentials
username, password, err := service.Load()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to load from keychain: %v", err)
}
fmt.Printf("Username: %s, Password: %s\n", username, password)
```

### Updating Credentials
Update existing credentials in the keychain:
```go
// Update credentials
err := service.Update("username", "newPassword456")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to update keychain: %v", err)
}
```
### Deleting Credentials
Delete credentials associated with a service:
```go
// Delete credentials
err := service.Delete()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Failed to delete from keychain: %v", err)
}
```
### Error Handling
The library provides detailed error messages directly from the macOS Security framework.
Always check for errors after keychain operations, especially in production environments.
```go
err := service.Save("username", "password123")
if err != nil {
    // Handle errors appropriately
    // The error messages come directly from the Security framework
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Keychain error: %v\n", err)
}
```

### Complete Example
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"

    "github.com/Fabianexe/purekeychain"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new service
    service := purekeychain.New("MyApp")

    // Save credentials
    err := service.Save("johndoe", "securePassword123")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to save: %v", err)
    }
    
    // Retrieve credentials
    username, password, err := service.Load()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to load: %v", err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("Retrieved credentials: %s / %s\n", username, password)
    
    // Update password
    err = service.Update(username, "newPassword456")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to update: %v", err)
    }
    
    // Verify update
	username, newPassword, err := service.Load()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to load: %v", err)
	}
    fmt.Printf("Updated password: %s / %s\n", username, newPassword)
    
    // Delete the entry when no longer needed
    err = service.Delete()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to delete: %v", err)
    }
    
    fmt.Println("Keychain operations completed successfully")
}
```

## Security Considerations

- This library handles sensitive information. Always follow security best practices.
- Keychain items are protected by macOS's security mechanisms.
- The library uses the user's default login keychain.

## Limitations

- macOS only
- Some advanced Keychain features are not implemented
